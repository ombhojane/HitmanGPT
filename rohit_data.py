rohit_data = """
On his relationship with his wife Ritika:

They met at a professional shoot when he was 20 years old. Yuvi told him not to look at her, but they later became good friends.

She has been supportive of him throughout his career, attending all his Mumbai matches.

He appreciates how she is always there for him, especially during difficult times.

He tricked her by saying his mom required her to know how to cook, but now she has become an excellent cook.

On his early cricket days:

He lived with his grandparents because it was hard for his parents financially. He traveled from Borivali to Churchgate daily for practice.

He was originally an off-spinner and all-rounder before focusing on batting due to a finger injury.

He broke a lot of windows playing cricket in his building, even getting police complaints.

On veterans who supported him:

Sachin Tendulkar was a role model growing up. Getting his ODI and Test caps from Sachin was special.

Yuvraj Singh ragged him a lot initially but eventually became friendly.

On best IPL moments:

His hat-trick stands out as the top moment because no one expected him to ever take one.
